# Maven Market Sales Analysis using Power BI
Maven Market is a multi-national grocery chain with locations in Canada, Mexico and the United States. The task is to analyze their 1997-1998 sales data to uncover valuable insights. Using Power BI, I connected and shaped the source data, built a relational model, created calculated columns and measures, and designed an interactive report with insightful visualizations.

## Project Overview
In this analysis, I focused on answering key business questions related to sales performance, profitability, and customer behavior by leveraging a multi-year dataset. Here are the files I used from the Maven Market dataset:

1. MavenMarket_Calendar.csv
2. MavenMarket_Customers.csv
3. MavenMarket_Products.csv
4.  MavenMarket_Regions.csv
5. MavenMarket_Returns_1997â€“1998.csv
6. MavenMarket_Stores.csv
7. MavenMarket_Transactions_1997.csv
8. MavenMarket_Transactions_1998.csv
